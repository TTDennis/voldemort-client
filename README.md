[Voldemort](http://github.com/voldemort/voldemort) is the open source clone of Amazon DynamoDB, a distributed key-value store.

This project is a Node.js driver for Voldemort. It uses round-robin load balancing and does not support client-side routing of keyspace.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install voldemort
```

Run tests with

```bash
$ npm test
```

Requires a local Voldemort instance on port `6666`.

## Documentation

The client is based on the official client [specification](https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/Writing-own-client-for-Voldemort).

### Example

Please notice that error handling is left out for brevity.

```js
var Voldemort = require('voldemort');
// Create a client against local voldemort, with default store `products`.
Voldemort.bootstrap([{ host: 'localhost', port: 6666 }], { store: 'products' }, function (err, client) {
  // Retrieve 'product1' from 'products' store.
  client.get('product1', function (err, product) {
    console.log(product.value);   //Buffer value
    console.log(product.version); //VectorClock
  });
});
```

### TODO

  * keep alive connection and use `pb0` response as ping/pong.


## API

### Voldemort#bootstrap(hosts, [options,] done)

Returns a new Voldemort instance bootstrapped against the array of hosts.
Will initialize the cluster information against the first working host.

Options:
  * `store:string` Set a default store for this client. If not set, store must
    be set with every request (`#get` etc).
  * `valueSerializer:Serializer` { serialize: fn (value), deserialize: fn (value) }
    Values are passed through `serialize` on insertion, and `deserialize` on retrieval.
    Defaults to returning raw buffer on retrieval.
  * `keySerializer:Serializer` {serialize: fn(value), deserialize: fn(value)}
    Keys are passed through `serialize` on insertion, and `deserialize` on retrieval.
    Defaults to string deserialization on retrieval.
  * `timeout:integer` Default `10000`. Timeout requests after `timeout` ms.
  * `reconnectInterval:integer` Default `500`. Round robin batch size. The
    client will change node after this many requests to distribute load across
    the cluster.
  * `randomize:bool` Default `true`. Set to `false` to disable randomizing node
    selection in cluster. This will use the nodes in-order starting from the
    bootstrap node.
  * `routing:string` Either "client" or "server".

### voldemort#get(key, [options,] done)
Gets the value of `key` from the default store or `options.store` if set.
Returns [Versioned](proto/voldemort-client.proto#L22) or `null` if `key` doesn't exist.

Options:
  * `store:string` Store to query for `key`. Required if no default store is set in `#bootstrap`.
  * `shouldRoute:bool` Set to `false` to disable serverside routing.

### voldemort#getAll(keys, [options,] done)
Gets the values of `keys` from the default store or `options.store` if set.
Returns `Object({key: version})` or empty object if no `keys` exist.

Options:
  * `store:string` Store to query for `keys`. Required if no default store is set in `#bootstrap`.
  * `shouldRoute:bool` Set to `false` to disable serverside routing.


### voldemort#put(key, value, [options,] done)
Puts the values of `keys` into the default store or `options.store` if set.
Returns [Versioned](proto/voldemort-client.proto#L22) or `null` on error.

Options:
  * `version:VectorClock` Optional. If not set, fetches the current version
    of `key` before putting. If set, puts the version given, or errors if outdated.
  * `store:string` Required if no default store is set in `#bootstrap`.
  * `shouldRoute:bool` Set to `false` to disable serverside routing.


### voldemort#del(key, [options,] done)
Deletes `key` from the store.

Options:
  * `version:VectorClock` Optional. If not set, fetches the current version
    of `key` before deleting. If set, puts the version given, or errors if outdated.
  * `store:string` Required if no default store is set in `#bootstrap`.
  * `shouldRoute:bool` Set to `false` to disable serverside routing.


### voldemort#close(done)
Close the active connection with voldemort.
